The print function is smart enough to handle multiple inputs.

For example, take a look at the line of code below. Then run `python src/chapter0/exercise0b.py`
"""

print("Hello", "World")

"""
Do you see how the print function printed the first word, then a space, and then the second word?

Practice printing multiple inputs.

# Print a message that says "Welcome to coding!", but using commas between each word
# and make sure to double check your work


print("Welcome", "to", "coding!")
# Print your top 3 climates, with each climate separated by a comma
print("75 degrees", "70 degrees", "60 degrees")
