Let's practice working with numbers - integers and floats!

Integers are whole numbers, and floats are decimal numbers

Now let's work with floats
"""

# Create a float variable for expected rainfall in inches (like 1.2 or 0.5)

# Create a float variable for wind speed in mph (like 8.7)

# Print both of your float variables

# Do some math: calculate what the wind speed would be if it doubled

# Convert a temperature: if it's 20 degrees Celsius, what is it in Fahrenheit?
# Formula: (Celsius * 9/5) + 32
